Update of Trunkens mod
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1731170217

**The release of RimWorld 1.6 added improved support for [Asset Bundles](https://github.com/emipa606/AssetBuilder/blob/main/README.md).**
To avoid doubling the size of the mod, it was re-released using only Asset Bundles, you can find the new version of this mod [here](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3503503505).
This version will not receive any further updates.

- CE-patch is now included in the main CE-mod instead

# Content


This was made for everyone who likes Mechanoid Power Source and the little Quest theme which stands behind it. You collect an item after an epic fight with some horrifying alien robots (The Power Cell), which grants you access to a variety of cool features like passive energy after research. While you investigate it more, your scientists will discover its raw power in warfare. Master Blaster adds a selection of weapons to this rewarding system:
