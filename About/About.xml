[h1]Content[/h1]

This was made for everyone who likes Mechanoid Power Source and the little Quest theme which stands behind it. You collect an item after an epic fight with some horrifying alien robots (The Power Cell), which grants you access to a variety of cool features like passive energy after research. While you investigate it more, your scientists will discover its raw power in warfare. Master Blaster adds a selection of weapons to this rewarding system:
